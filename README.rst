Javascript and HTML5
====================

This project contains exercises I completed while reading
"Head First HTML5 Programming: Building Web Apps with JavaScript" by
Eric Freeman and Elisabeth Robson.

The book is broken down as follows:

* Chapter 1: Getting to know HTML5
* Chapter 2: Introducing JavaScript and the DOM
* Chapter 3: Events and handlers
* Chapter 4: Javascript functions and objects
* Chapter 5: Geolocation
* Chapter 6: Talking to the web
* Chapter 7: Canvas
* Chapter 8: Video
* Chapter 9: Web storage
* Chapter 10: Web workers


Chapter 5 - Geolocation
-----------------------
This chapter covers geolocation. Based on the info in the book, I made a
small app that shows where the user is located relative to "HQ".

I deployed the app on Heroku:
https://javascript-geolocation.herokuapp.com/myLoc.html

Have some extra time on your hands? Use the app to find where HQ is.
You'll be glad you did!
