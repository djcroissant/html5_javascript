Javascript and HTML5
====================

This project contains exercises I completed while reading

Eric Freeman and Elisabeth Robson.

The book is broken down as follows:

* Chapter 1: Getting to know HTML5
* Chapter 2: Introducing JavaScript and the DOM
* Chapter 3: Events and handlers
* Chapter 4: Javascript functions and objects
* Chapter 5: Geolocation
* Chapter 6: Talking to the web
* Chapter 7: Canvas
* Chapter 8: Video
* Chapter 9: Web storage
* Chapter 10: Web workers


Additional Information
----------------------

Chapter 5 - Geolocation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This chapter covers geolocation. Based on the info in the book, I made a
small app that shows where the user is located relative to "HQ". The
app makes use of Google Maps API to show the user's location as a pin
on a map.

I deployed the app on Heroku:
https://javascript-geolocation.herokuapp.com/myLoc.html

Have some extra time on your hands? Use the app to find where HQ is.
You'll be glad you did!


Chapter 7 - Canvas
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Twitter API no longer supports the ability to request a user's
timeline through XMLHttpRequest. So I simulated a few tweets instead.
The exercise allows users to pick a background color, shape, text color,
and a "tweet". The user's selections are drawn on a canvas, which is then
printed on a t-shirt and shipped to the user. Next
steps would be to implement a business strategy, supply pipeline,
manufacturing facility, and a small HR department. Then should be good to go.
